# Project Movies

This week's project was to fetch movie API:s using React router to load dynamic content. 

## The problem

This was the first time I build a multi-page React application. To do that I used React router. Other techniques I used to get everything working is useEffect, useState and useParams. I did two fetches of two different endpoints, one to show a list op popular movies and one fetch to get the movie details of each movie. I started by doing a sketch with what components to use, and what they should contain. If I had more time I would have made an animation on the back button and make the site look better in tablet view.
